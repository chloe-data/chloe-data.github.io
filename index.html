Welcome to my portfolio!
I am a user experience researcher in London, UK. I focus my work in healthcare and personal digital health technologies.
At the end of October, I will be gladly at Pittsburgh, PA for ASSETS'19 - would love to meet up if you'll be at the conference or
around the region!
Meanwhile, this site is currently under diligent construction - sorry for the inconvenience. For now, feel free to check out the <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/">Projects</a> page for some of my work!.
