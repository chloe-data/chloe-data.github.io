Thanks for dropping by!
<br><br>
I am a user experience researcher and designer. My passion is
to understand and improve the intersection between human and technology,
I am curious to learn about individuals as a researcher.
Through designing and executing research studies, I elicit how people expect
things to work and translate the findings into actionable insights.

<br><br>
 Having experiences in mixed-method study
 in the full research lifecycle, I also design interfaces to translate findings into actionable insights.
 My recent project involves studying the
 user experience of a wearable device for rehabilitation, in which part of the
 work is published at ACM SIG ASSETS'19 SRC.
 <br><br>
 Always interested to solve complex design problems through research.
 Feel free to check out some of my work at the Projects page. If you have any questions or comments on my work, do get in touch!
