Hi there!
<br><br>
I'm a User Experience Researcher passionate about understanding 
    how people interact with technology and finding ways to make those interactions more meaningful and enjoyable. 
    My work focuses on designing and conducting research studies to uncover user needs and expectations, translating these insights into actionable recommendations for product development.
<br><br>
One of my recent projects involved investigating the user experience of a wearable rehabilitation device, with some of my findings published at ACM SIG ASSETS'19 SRC.
 <br><br>
 I'm always eager to tackle complex design challenges through user-centered research. Feel free to explore my portfolio on the Projects page â€“ I hope you find it interesting! I'd love to hear your thoughts and answer any questions you may have.
<br>
