Thanks for dropping by!

I am Chloe, a user researcher whose passion is
understanding and improving the intersection between human and technology,
I am curious to learn about individuals as a researcher.
I enjoy designing methods to probe people to share their what they think
 and how they expect things to work.

 I have experience in mixed-method study
 in the full research lifecycle in the industry and academia. My recent project involves studying the user experience of a wearable device for
 rehabilitation, in which part of the work is published at ACM SIG ASSETS'19.
 Feel free to check out some of my work here. I'd love to discuss with you how
 my skills can be applied to your projects.
