<p><b>
Thanks for dropping by!
<br><br>
I am Chloe, a user researcher whose passion is
understanding and improving the intersection between human and technology,
I am curious to learn about individuals as a researcher.
I enjoy designing methods to probe people to share what they think
 and how they expect things to work.
<br><br>
 I have experience in mixed-method study
 in the full research lifecycle. My recent project involves studying the user experience of a wearable device for
 rehabilitation, in which part of the work is published at ACM SIG ASSETS'19 SRC.
 <br><br>
 As I am always interested to solve complex design problems through research,
 feel free to check out some of my work here, and let's get in touch!
