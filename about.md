    <h2>User Researcher</h2>
    <p><b>Being passionate about understanding and improving the intersection between human and technology, I am curious to learn about individuals as a user researcher.

      <h2>Product Person</h2>
      <p><b>I previously worked in user research and product management in the technology industry.

I also co-hosted workshops teaching users to interact with the software. <span class="evidence"><b>These experiences enable me to communicate concisely with both engineers and designers.</b></span></b>
      <br>
      <b>I am very excited to learn new technologies and to solve design problem through research.</b>

      <h2>Health Tech Advocate</h2>
      <p><b>Apart from research, I actively advocate for health technologies including digital therapeutics, quantified self, medical tech. As a tech officer at <a href = 'http://www.uclmed.tech/' target="_blank">UCL MedTech</a> , I am responsible for mentoring participants in the recent PulseHackathon, in collaboration with the MIT hackathon team. <span class="evidence"><b>My interest in solving healthcare problem with technologies is truly aligned with my work in MedTech UCL.</b></span> During my time there, I organised seminars with industry leaders, such as startup founders and women in tech to share their experience. These experiences, concurrently done with my research work, have equipped me with multitasking skill under time constraints, and the ability to present ideas to people with different areas of expertise.</b>
