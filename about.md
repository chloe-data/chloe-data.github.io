<p>During my time at UCL, I was a MSc researcher in Human-Computer Interaction,
          the Tech Officer at <a href = 'http://www.uclmed.tech/' target="_blank">UCL MedTech</a> & the Education
          Officer at <a href = 'https://www.facebook.com/londonblockchainlabs/' target="_blank">London Blockchain Lab</a>.
        </p>
<p>Some of the projects I have done
          include designing research to study the impact of automobile
          voice interface usage on driver stress, qualitative and  quantitative (lab experiment) data analysis as well as
          a group project to design visitor experience in museum.
        </p>
<p> Besides study, I especially love the student activities in London universities.
           I was a mentor in <a href = 'https://pulsehack.io/' target="_blank">PulseHack</a>, a health technology hackathon co-organised by UCL MedTech and MIT hackathon team. I also helped out in MedTech conferences.

          Before London,  I was working in a software team in Cisco (San Jose, CA), where I was
          responsible for some more product management work. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to represent
           my team in conferences. I delivered 2 product presentations and led 2
           interactive workshops with software engineers from my team. The above
           is taken at <a href = 'https://ciscolive.cisco.com/emea/?cid=cleur1102&fbclid=IwAR0-7xBxkDluLLRWlt936QNtXoD1XEfsKdLNbDQHjIa84ANBuY7le8KkMrM' target="_blank" >CiscoLive Berlin</a>.
        </p>

<p>Prior to that, I worked in IBM as a user testing intern.
          It was a great client side experience as my team was working inside
          an airline company. The goal of the project was to streamline an online booking system.
          I wrote many (>1k) test cases and got a taste of working directly with
          the client through project meetings.
