<p>During my time at UCL, I was a MSc researcher in Human-Computer Interaction,
          the Tech Officer at <a href = 'http://www.uclmed.tech/' target="_blank">UCL MedTech</a> & the Education
          Officer at <a href = 'https://www.facebook.com/londonblockchainlabs/' target="_blank">London Blockchain Lab</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the projects I have done
          include designing research to study the impact of automobile
          voice interface usage on driver stress, qualitative and  quantitative (lab experiment) data analysis as well as
          a group project to design visitor experience in museum.
        </p>
        <p> Besides study, I especially love the student activities in London universities.
           I was a mentor in <a href = 'https://pulsehack.io/' target="_blank">PulseHack</a>, a health technology hackathon co-organised by UCL MedTech and MIT hackathon team. I also helped out in MedTech conferences.
