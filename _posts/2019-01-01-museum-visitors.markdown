To begin to develop an understanding of our usersâ€™ needs, we constructed a questionnaire consisting of both open and closed questions. The questions explored general themes relating to visiting frequencies and durations, motivations for visiting, and issues surrounding comfortable interaction with others. We recruited people online and in-person outside of art museums in London, resulting in a total of 60 responses.


### Interview and observation
10 semi-structured interviews

In addition, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 visitors and 5 members of staff at Tate Modern. The themes of the visitor interview focused more specifically on interaction preferences, whilst the staff interview was adapted to include their observations of visitor-visitor/visitor-staff interaction and their knowledge of how interaction was encouraged by the museum.
