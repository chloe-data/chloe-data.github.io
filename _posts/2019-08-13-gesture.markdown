#### Background
Interaction techniques for mobile games have developed massively as the capabilities of mobile devices have become sophisticated. However, work on interaction techniques for mobile gaming focuses mainly on single- player games and are expert-designed. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by investigating touch and mid-air gestures as input control for co-located mobile gaming from a user perspective, specifically using board and card games due to the materiality of their game artefacts and the rich interaction between players. Through a gesture elicitation study with 12 dyads, we obtained touch and mid-air gesture proposals for 11 game tasks, as well as insights into user preferences. This paper extends prior gesture elicitation work for cross-device interaction by applying the elicitation methodology in co-located mobile gaming. We contribute to the classification and analysis of 622 gestures, resulting in a consensus gesture set, a gesture taxonomy showing more collaborative gestures in the mid-air modality, and agreement rates showing higher consensus for touch gestures. We identified themes from participantsâ€™ feedback, which offer guidelines for future game and gesture design. With the rise of gesture-based control mobile devices, we believe this work can be a reference point for future mobile game gesture design.

#### Research Approach
##### Method
I conducted gesture elicitation session with 24 participants using priming and pairing methods to encourage out-of-the-box proposals.

* The results highlight a <b>dichotomy</b> between stroke patients/caregivers and domain experts.

* From the CEQ, we learnt that <b>both stroke patients and caregivers considered the device as credible</b> and expected hand dexterity improvements from using the device.

* In contrast, <b>domain experts did not see the device as credible</b> and useful to improve impaired hand motor function.

* The reason might be that <span class="evidence">participantsâ€™ feedback for the device is associated with their <b>previous experience</b> with rehabilitative device</span>.

The four themes emerged from the interviews were:
* <b>Perceived Efficacy</b> - Participants were able to propose use case scenarios to put the device in the context of patient daily life.

* <b>Combining device usage with current physiotherapies and ADL</b> - Participants understood how the device can help in rehabilitation, but would also like to see how the device can aid daily activities instead of only the existing pre-defined movements.

* <b>Negative feedback for the exoskeleton mechanism</b> -  Most participants expressed negative feedback towards the process of putting on the device, and the slow and restrained movement mechanism.

* <b>Weight and Appearance</b> - Participants appreciated the pleasing design, but some pointed out the room for improvement in terms of its size and weight.
