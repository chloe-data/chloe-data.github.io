#### Background
Interaction techniques for mobile games have developed massively as the capabilities of mobile devices have become sophisticated. However, work on interaction techniques for mobile gaming focuses mainly on single- player games and are expert-designed. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by investigating touch and mid-air gestures as input control for co-located mobile gaming from a user perspective, specifically using board and card games due to the materiality of their game artefacts and the rich interaction between players. Through a gesture elicitation study with 12 dyads, we obtained touch and mid-air gesture proposals for 11 game tasks, as well as insights into user preferences. This paper extends prior gesture elicitation work for cross-device interaction by applying the elicitation methodology in co-located mobile gaming. We contribute to the classification and analysis of 622 gestures, resulting in a consensus gesture set, a gesture taxonomy showing more collaborative gestures in the mid-air modality, and agreement rates showing higher consensus for touch gestures. We identified themes from participantsâ€™ feedback, which offer guidelines for future game and gesture design. With the rise of gesture-based control mobile devices, we believe this work can be a reference point for future mobile game gesture design.

##### Method
I conducted gesture elicitation session with 24 participants using priming and pairing methods to encourage out-of-the-box proposals.
