## Redesigning a ticket machine at Euston Train Station
<b>Project type: </b> Critical Interface Analysis and Redesign

<b>Team size: </b> Individual project
<div class="breaker"></div>
<b>
This is a design activity in my Interaction Design class. We first choose a physical interface we use in our daily life that we could improve on, then we perform a heuristic evaluation with regard to human factor concepts. After analysing the interface and locating rooms for improvement, we propose new design or design refinement on the existing interface.
</b>
<b>
I decided to evaluate this ticket vending area where I passed by every day. This area is full of passengers commuting to other parts of the UK via the national rail, and within London via tube and overground services. Purchasing or collecting train tickets at a self-service machine can sometimes be a pain. Although most interaction remains on screen, the design of physical machine can help increase learnability and save commuters' time, thus avoid long queues at the ticket office. This is why a user-friendly ticket vending machine is useful in reducing people flow at the station, saving waiting time, and helping us catch the train!
</b>
<b>
In short, this redesign project focus on the two parts:
(1) To critically analyse the existing user interface of a ticket vending machine and point out the potential problems
(2) To address the identified problems with design improvements of the machine interface

Here is a two-page explanation focusing on the evaluation and design process:

<b> At the end of this design activity, we presented our conceptual design and critique one another's at a design artefact showcase with other designers.  This is an A2-sized poster created for a design critique and showcase:
