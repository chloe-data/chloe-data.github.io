### Background
In this project, I worked on evaluating and improving a patient data dashboard prototype. The dashboard was intended to inform different stakeholders the real-time data they need for better patient care in the intensive care unit.

This project was in collaboration with the Health Informatics Team at UCLH. When I started my work with them, the team already have an interactive physical dashboard prototype with fictional data for testing. I worked with a UX designer and another researcher for the field work to understand how well the existing prototype address the user need.

### My contribution
I took on the front role of interviewing one of the major user groups for patient data dashboard.

### Findings
*

### What did I learn


### Update
* After the group project, I represented my team to present this work to the UCLH Health Informatics Team. I have learnt a lot as a researcher through the interaction with different stakeholders in the team, including their junior doctors, critical care consultants, data scientists, and UX designer. I came to realise that working as an 'outsider' could actually be beneficial to the team as I observe workflow and listen to user need with a fresh mindset. Feedback from the team was positive on our findings.
