## Realtime Patient Data Dashboard at the ICU
<b>Project type: </b> Mixed-method User Research

<b>Team size: </b> A team of 6 from psychology, computer science and UI design backgrounds

<b>My role: </b> User Researcher

<b>Methods: </b> Field visit, semi-structured interview, thematic analysis, contextual enquiry

### Background
In this project, <span class="evidence">I worked on evaluating and improving a patient data dashboard prototype. The dashboard was intended to provide real-time ward data, so as to inform timely decision making, thereby better patient care at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).</span>

This project was in collaboration with the Health Informatics Team at UCLH. When I started my work with them, the team already have an interactive physical dashboard prototype with fictional data for user testing. I worked as a user researcher to conduct the field work to understand how well the existing prototype address the user need.

### Research approach
I used semi-structured interview accompanied with observation during an ICU visit. I interviewed junior doctor, one of the user groups in this study.

Semi-structured interview is a common qualitative research approach in health services when we want to understand subjective perspectives. <span class="evidence">Interviewing users allows me to understand the user workflow and mental models flexibly. Following an interview protocol prepared earlier, I asked the doctor questions under different points of interests, but also follow-ip questions on the new ideas raised by the interviewee. Being able to ask follow-up questions right away was also a benefit of semi-structured interview as it allows the flexibility to dig deep on insights.</span>

<span class="evidence">The fact that we were conducting the interview at an open corridor at the ICU, though initially a constraint due to the doctor's tight schedule, as well encouraged interaction with the staff who passed by.</span> This not only made the interview process more relaxing, but also sparked discussion surrounding the use of dashboard and general opinions among other staff members.

As the interviewee explained the difficulty around patient information retrieval, I observed the entire workflow of getting the heart rate of one patient at the existing  Intensive Care Information Platform (ICIP).

### Findings
During the analysis, I represented the user journey as <i>a day in the life of junior doctor</i> in a concise way. I extracted significant timestamps from the work that the doctor does in a "typical" day, a "good" day, and a "bad" day to formulate the timeline.
Each timestamp represent a point of interaction with the dashboard.

A few themes emerged after the thematic analysis of interview transcription.

#### Target metrics

<span class="evidence">Amalgamated data on all metrics would be helpful for junior doctor, i.e. statistics on all patients' progress collectively</span>, in contrast to what a nurse would prefer, i.e. to go through each patient individually.

<span class="evidence">We also discovered some target metrics necessary in the doctor's workflow that the existing prototype lacks:</span>
* Antibiotic taken
* Time last taken
* Urine output
* Length of Stay
* Average temperature
* Heart rate
* No. of patients being ventilated



#### User Interface

<span class="evidence">The map visualization of the ICU was particularly appreciated. It fits into the mental model of the staff when navigating around the ICU. It was easy for them to associate a patient with a location on a map.</span>


<span class="evidence">However, the doctor was confused about how to navigate back to the main page as well as the meanings of different colors on the map.</span>

#### Potential risks

<b>Staff morality</b>

<span class="evidence">The dashboard could lead to a blame culture: wherever out of standard metrics are seen, the responsible nurse is held accountable and might be seen as incompetent.</span> Yet, the patient might just be very sick at that moment, regardless of the nurse’s ability.

<span class="evidence">Although patient care is the top priority, people relationships and a healthy work culture are also important and will inevitably affect patient care.</span> If the technology promotes a blame culture, its usefulness is massively reduced and may even lead to abandonment.


<b>Data safety</b>

The current dashboard prototype is located at the corridor outside the staff rest room. Although it is enclosed within the ICU, there are risks that relatives would misinterpret information presented on the dashboard.


#### Dashboard location and Access control
Concerns on the dashboard location and access control
> <i>If it [the dashboard] was nearer the front desk that makes me uncomfortable because of confidentiality, but also because this is the sort of thing that can cause alarm for their relatives.</i>

Data accuracy, backup plan
>If you change your system to incorporate a new bit of technology, it needs to prove its worth, otherwise I would lose faith.

Target metrics
> Because I suspect a lot of the ward staff don’t what the tidal volume should be, having a little bit of detail why it’s set to that may be useful.


	- Competitive culture
		○ I think one of the things that is a bit concerning is the potential for it to create a little bit of conflict or tension.
		○ If I'm the doctor allocated to this bay, and all of my patients are is green or red (whatever color we go with in the end), then is that going to make everybody think, "Oh my God, what is she doing? Look, her bay's all gone off and everybody else is doing great." Or they might actually just be really sick and none of us are able to fix it. But, just looking at this, you can't see that



	- "…if it was nearer the front desk, where you guys were waiting for us, then members of the public coming in to visit their relatives will come and see and that makes me uncomfortable for two reasons: because of confidentiality, but also because this is the sort of thing that can cause alarm."
"… just looking at this, [refer to the red coded patient bed shown on the dashboard]…, it kind of flags up those four patients and it does suggest that the people looking after these patients are doing something wrong. "

### Outcome and Deliverables
* After the group project, I represented my team to present this work to the UCLH Health Informatics Team. I have learnt a lot as a researcher through the interaction with different stakeholders in the team, including their junior doctors, critical care consultants, data scientists, and UX designer. I came to realise that working as an 'outsider' could actually be beneficial to the team as I observe workflow and listen to user need with a fresh mindset. Feedback from the team was positive on our findings.
