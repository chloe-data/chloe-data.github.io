## Realtime Patient Data Dashboard at the ICU
<b>Project type: </b> Mixed-method User Research

<b>Team size: </b> A team of 6 from psychology, computer science and UI design backgrounds

<b>My role: </b> User Researcher

<b>Methods: </b> Field visit, semi-structured interview, thematic analysis, contextual enquiry

### Background
In this project, I worked on evaluating and improving a patient data dashboard prototype. The dashboard was intended to provide real-time ward data, so as to inform timely decision making, and therefore better patient care at the intensive care unit.

This project was in collaboration with the Health Informatics Team at UCLH. When I started my work with them, the team already have an interactive physical dashboard prototype with fictional data for user testing. I worked as a user researcher to conduct the field work to understand how well the existing prototype address the user need.

### Research approach


### My contribution
I took on the role to interview one of the major user groups for patient data dashboard - junior doctor. I


During the analysis, I suggested using the <i>a day in the life of junior doctor</i> as a way to present the user journey in a concise way. I extracted significant timestamps from the work that the doctor does in a "typical" day, a "good" day, and a "bad" day to formulate the timeline.

### Findings
After the thematic analysis of interview transcription, a few themes emerged.

The current dashboard prototype is located at the corridor outside the staff rest room. Although it is located within the Unit, that is only staff, patients, and relatives would be able to
Concerns on the dashboard location and access control
> <i>If it [the dashboard] was nearer the front desk that makes me uncomfortable because of confidentiality, but also because this is the sort of thing that can cause alarm for their relatives.</i>

Data accuracy, backup plan
>If you change your system to incorporate a new bit of technology, it needs to prove its worth, otherwise I would lose faith.

Target metrics
> Because I suspect a lot of the ward staff don’t what the tidal volume should be, having a little bit of detail why it’s set to that may be useful.

		○ Anitbiotic taken, time frame


	- Competitive culture
		○ I think one of the things that is a bit concerning is the potential for it to create a little bit of conflict or tension.
		○ If I'm the doctor allocated to this bay, and all of my patients are is green or red (whatever color we go with in the end), then is that going to make everybody think, "Oh my God, what is she doing? Look, her bay's all gone off and everybody else is doing great." Or they might actually just be really sick and none of us are able to fix it. But, just looking at this, you can't see that



	- "…if it was nearer the front desk, where you guys were waiting for us, then members of the public coming in to visit their relatives will come and see and that makes me uncomfortable for two reasons: because of confidentiality, but also because this is the sort of thing that can cause alarm."
"… just looking at this, [refer to the red coded patient bed shown on the dashboard]…, it kind of flags up those four patients and it does suggest that the people looking after these patients are doing something wrong. "

### What did I learn

### Outcome and Deliverables
* After the group project, I represented my team to present this work to the UCLH Health Informatics Team. I have learnt a lot as a researcher through the interaction with different stakeholders in the team, including their junior doctors, critical care consultants, data scientists, and UX designer. I came to realise that working as an 'outsider' could actually be beneficial to the team as I observe workflow and listen to user need with a fresh mindset. Feedback from the team was positive on our findings.
