### Background
In this project, I worked on evaluating and improving a patient data dashboard prototype. The dashboard was intended to provide real-time ward data, so as to inform timely decision making, and therefore better patient care at the intensive care unit.

This project was in collaboration with the Health Informatics Team at UCLH. When I started my work with them, the team already have an interactive physical dashboard prototype with fictional data for user testing. I worked as a user researcher to conduct the field work to understand how well the existing prototype address the user need.s

### My contribution
I took on the role to interview one of the major user groups for patient data dashboard - junior doctor.

I prepared my part of questions curated from

### What did I learn


### Outcome and Deliverables 
* After the group project, I represented my team to present this work to the UCLH Health Informatics Team. I have learnt a lot as a researcher through the interaction with different stakeholders in the team, including their junior doctors, critical care consultants, data scientists, and UX designer. I came to realise that working as an 'outsider' could actually be beneficial to the team as I observe workflow and listen to user need with a fresh mindset. Feedback from the team was positive on our findings.
