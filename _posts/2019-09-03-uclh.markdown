### Background
In this project, I took on the front role of interviewing one of the major user groups for patient data dashboard.

### Findings
* <b>Weight and Appearance</b> - Participants appreciated the pleasing design, but some pointed out the room for improvement in terms of its size and weight.

### What did I learn


### Update
* After the group project, I represented my team to present this work to the UCLH Health Informatics Team. I have learnt a lot as a researcher through the interaction with different stakeholders in the team, including their junior doctors, critical care consultants, data scientists, and UX designer. I came to realise that working as an 'outsider' could actually be beneficial to the team as I observe workflow and listen to user need with a fresh mindset. Feedback from the team was positive on our findings.
